__Tushar Mittal__

Hello!
I am Tushar Mittal and I am a graduate student at Ross School of Business pursuing my Master of Business Analytics (MBAn). I am an international student from Nepal and did my undergraduate at Ramapo College of New Jersey where I double majored in Accounting and Finance. After my undergraduate, I worked at Deloitte as an Audit and Assurance Analyst in the Philadelphia office, and quickly realized that I wanted to learn more about Analytics and Data. Itâ€™s just my first semester at Ross, and I have already learnt so much! I look forward to making the best out of my time here at University of Michigan and expanding my network!

I enjoy traveling and visiting new places and believe in giving my ðŸ’¯% in whatever I do. In my free time, I like to cook, play video games, or read about new and interesting topics surrounding business and tech. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!

Recently graduated from my second bachelor's degree in Economics, I am now a current Master of Business Analytics student at Ross (University of Michigan). 

I am originally from Spain with a previous background in **Dietetics** and **Sport Nutrition**. During my time in Spain and after 6 years in the **Health** field, I moved to the United States and decided to change careers to **Economics**. 

Crossing the pond for my first time in 2019 meant starting from zero: language, culture, making friends, food, career, etc. Getting involved with the community through voluntary activities while studying English, prepared me to an **English academic level in less than two years** to start my second degree in Economics. 

As a **Military Spouse**, life changes every three years, so my option to start a new career had to be online. This lifestyle tough me *to get comfortable when being uncomfortable*. As an example, the time to move for the next assignment was in the middle of my first semester, when we had to move to England (my current home). A fun fact is that I had to study on the floor for two weeks until we got some borrowed furniture. After two years and a half, I graduated this past May 2023, and a month later I started the MBAn's program which is inspiring me to keep growing and overcome my barriers to be the best version of myself.
