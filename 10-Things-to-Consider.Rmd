# Things to Consider

AI can provide benefit in a vast number of fields as shown through the examples in various industries. In order for AI to be beneficial for a company, its implementation needs to be carefully planned. To implement AI in a way that will be useful in a company, there needs to be “a comprehensive shift in organizational culture and operations” so that members of a company are aware of the changes and can properly use AI (Marr, 2023). There needs to be “buy-in from all levels” of employees in a company to get on board with adopting this new technology so that employees are willing to adapt and make the necessary changes to their everyday work activities (The Biggest Barriers to Technology Adoption in Business, 2021). Certain employees will need to be retrained so that they are able to utilize and understand how to use AI in their role (Fleming, 2020). This requires a large investment from the company to pay for these changes (Marr, 2023). Providing training may also take time away from employees’ work duties, but it is necessary in order for AI adoption to be successful. Developing an AI for a company is not useful if people in the company do not  know how to utilize the AI in their role. AI is an investment which requires monetary resources and time in order for it to provide benefit for a company.
