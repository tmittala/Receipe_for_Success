## Tushar Mittal

Hello!
I am Tushar Mittal and I am a graduate student at Ross School of Business pursuing my Master of Business Analytics (MBAn). I am an international student from Nepal and did my undergraduate at Ramapo College of New Jersey where I double majored in Accounting and Finance. After my undergraduate, I worked at Deloitte as an Audit and Assurance Analyst in the Philadelphia office, and quickly realized that I wanted to learn more about Analytics and Data. Itâ€™s just my first semester at Ross, and I have already learnt so much! I look forward to making the best out of my time here at University of Michigan and expanding my network!

I enjoy traveling and visiting new places and believe in giving my ðŸ’¯% in whatever I do. In my free time, I like to cook, play video games, or read about new and interesting topics surrounding business and tech. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmittala/)!

## Maria Viera

Recently graduated from my second bachelor's degree in Economics, I am now a current Master of Business Analytics student at Ross (University of Michigan). 

I am originally from Spain with a previous background in **Dietetics** and **Sport Nutrition**. During my time in Spain and after 6 years in the **Health** field, I moved to the United States and decided to change careers to **Economics**. 

Crossing the pond for my first time in 2019 meant starting from zero: language, culture, making friends, food, career, etc. Getting involved with the community through voluntary activities while studying English, prepared me to an **English academic level in less than two years** to start my second degree in Economics. 

As a **Military Spouse**, life changes every three years, so my option to start a new career had to be online. This lifestyle tough me *to get comfortable when being uncomfortable*. As an example, the time to move for the next assignment was in the middle of my first semester, when we had to move to England (my current home). A fun fact is that I had to study on the floor for two weeks until we got some borrowed furniture. After two years and a half, I graduated this past May 2023, and a month later I started the MBAn's program which is inspiring me to keep growing and overcome my barriers to be the best version of myself.

## Ashley Chen

Hello There! Iâ€™m Ashley, currently at Ross School of Business pursuing my Master of Business Analytics (MBAn). I graduated from the University of Washington, Seattle, with an Economics degree. 

After graduation, I had the incredible opportunity to work at TikTok's Data and AI Center, where I focused on business systems and databases. Subsequently, I joined Shopee's recommendation system team as a data analyst, helping them tailor their e-commerce homepage for 12 million users. These experiences have allowed me to witness how data analytics and data infrastructure can significantly empower businesses. Now Iâ€™m excited to delve deeper into the intersection of data and technology at Ross!
