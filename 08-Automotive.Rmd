# Automotive

For many, the idea of AI in the automotive industry conjures up images of autonomous or self-driving cars. These vehicles are certainly one of the more visible applications of the technology, but there is so much more behind the scenes — and under the proverbial hood. AI and automation has become essential in the design and production of automobiles, as well as the thousands of associated parts that go into every car. Automation and the use of smart robots has been crucial to the manufacturing process and AI is now being used across the whole value chain of mobility, from vehicle development to fleet servicing, enabling improvements in safety, cost, and quality. (Ranch, 2023)

The AI in the Automotive sector surpassed a value of $6 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to witness a growth rate exceeding 55% CAGR from 2023 to 2032. Several factors contribute to the escalating adoption of AI in this industry:

- Increasing consumer recognition of the advantages presented by autonomous technology.

- Governments are actively implementing various initiatives to foster innovation within the realm of autonomous vehicles.

- The surge in popularity of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assist System), an advanced automotive safety technology that operates at Level 2, is notably contributing to this trend.
