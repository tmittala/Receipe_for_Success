For many, the idea of AI in the automotive industry conjures up images of autonomous or self-driving cars. These vehicles are certainly one of the more visible applications of the technology, but there is so much more behind the scenes — and under the proverbial hood. AI and automation has become essential in the design and production of automobiles, as well as the thousands of associated parts that go into every car. Automation and the use of smart robots has been crucial to the manufacturing process and AI is now being used across the whole value chain of mobility, from vehicle development to fleet servicing, enabling improvements in safety, cost, and quality.

AI in Automotive market size exceeded USD 6 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at over 55% CAGR from 2023 to 2032. Some factors responsible for driving this rising adoption are: 
Growing customer awareness of the benefits of autonomous technology
Governments are taking numerous measures to promote innovation in autonomous vehicle landscape
ADAS (Advance Driver Assist System) an advanced car safety technology system  level that falls under Level 2 technology, is becoming increasingly popular
